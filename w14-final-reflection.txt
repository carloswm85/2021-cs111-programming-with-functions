Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

> Probably during the final project. I know mine was not a large one, but
the "chunks" of code I used for the few methods I used, and the tests.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

> Probably most developers don't make them just because it's some extra
work you have to do at any project, but the truth is that the effort
required for building them is very small, and the time the save us
in the long run at debbugging stages, can be huge.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

> Use testing methods and modules.
