Significant Program Proposal
https://byui-cse.github.io/cse111-course/lesson11/prove.html

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
> Folder Structure Maker (Probably I'll change the name later)

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
> It builds a required folder structure at a given disk location.
Folder names should be highly customizable. Here's an example:

	FolderRoot
		Folder1
			Folder1a
			Folder1b
		Folder2
			...
		Folder3
		...

> Adding dates or some other classification information should be
a feature of the program. I intend to add a GUI, for more friendly
user usage.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
> I'm not sure really. I will find that out. 

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
> Probably some of these: csv, tkinter or kivy, pytest, datetime, random,
functools, 

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
> YES

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
> YES
